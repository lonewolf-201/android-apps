If you want to download a TV SHOW just go to www.google.com and search for index of #*the name of your TV show*#
      For Example:
            index of arrow
 
The Search result shows you a number of Open Directories.

You can download it on your browser.

Instead of doing these things I have created an app that lets you download from these open directories.

You can also add your own open directories
Some Open Directories can be messed up so except some screwed up listview display.

To know more open directories go to this link -> https://www.reddit.com/r/opendirectories/comments/75ya8g/the_holy_grail_of_indexes/

Note: 
*You can download only video files.
I haven't figured out streaming yet.
Also yet to add subtitles support*
